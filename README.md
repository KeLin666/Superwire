# Superwire
This is a repository to build up basic concept about superwire, Anderson Localization, Branched flow.
Idea is based on the following two article:
1. Propagation of waves in high Brillouin zones: Chaotic branched flow and stable superwires
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2110285118

2. Achieving centimetre-scale supercollimation in a large-area two-dimensional photonic crystal - Nature Materials
https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat1568

## Difference and Analogy between Quantum simulation and paraxial optics
See analytical derivation in "From Maxwell Equation to Schrodinger Equation.pdf".

## Introduction to (1+1)D SSFFT method
See Matlab "NoteBookforSSFFT.mlx" notebook for detail introduction to (1+1)D split step method.

## Demostration about Anderson Localization
Here is a YouTube Link for a visual explanation about Anderson Localization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrOcj3F2BJ4
