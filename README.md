# Superwire
This is a repository to build up basic concept about superwire, Anderson Localization, Branched flow.
Idea is based on the following two article:
1. Propagation of waves in high Brillouin zones: Chaotic branched flow and stable superwires - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2110285118

2. Achieving centimetre-scale supercollimation in a large-area two-dimensional photonic crystal - Nature Materials
https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat1568

## Difference and Analogy between Quantum simulation and paraxial optics
See analytical derivation in "From Maxwell Equation to Schrodinger Equation.pdf".

## Introduction to (1+1)D SSFFT method
See Matlab "NoteBookforSSFFT.mlx" notebook for detail introduction to (1+1)D split step method.

## Demostration about Anderson Localization
Here is a YouTube Link for a visual explanation about Anderson Localization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrOcj3F2BJ4

## 2D Supercollimation beam simulation
In folder 0723Supercollimation2D, some pictures are shown to figure out the existance of supercollimation beam. Both absolute value and real part of beam profile are shown for better understanding.

## 3D Supercollimation beam simulation
Detail is shown in fold "0723Supercollimation3D". Similar to (1+1)D simulaion, we apply (2+1)D SSFFT method and see how beam profile will evolve in cos^2 lattice.
